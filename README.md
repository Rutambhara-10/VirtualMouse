# VirtualMouse

Virtual Mouse is an AI-Based Application that use Hand Gesture to access Mouse Cursor. The Goal of Virtual Mouse is to Manage computers and other devices with gestures rather than pointing, Clicking, or touching the display directly. Virtual Mouse can be used by a person who is not comfortable with touchpad/PhysicalMouse. Additionally, Virtual Mouse can be used in various Games and other AI Applications which dependent on the Controlled through User-Defined Gestures.

Using this Application, One can access the cursor for minimizing screen, maximize the screen, copy, paste, cut, and other functions which can be accessed through Physical Mouse. This Application uses a Real-Time camera to detect hand landmarks, tracks gesture patterns made by the User. Specifically, This Virtual Mouse detects index Finger and Middle Finger Movement and acts accordingly. Mouse Cursor can move when Index Finger is up. When the Index finger and Middle Finger both are up and when they are at a specific distance a Click Opeeartion is then Generated.

Virtual Mouse is a Python Application. Here are the main Python Packages used in Project. Virtual Mouse Consist of two python Scripts. One is pyHandTrackingModule.py and another is Mouse.py . 

1. OpenCV
    OpenCV is used for accessing the Real-time Camera(WebCam), drwing and Image Processing which gives inputs to the Virtual Mouse.
2. Mediapip
